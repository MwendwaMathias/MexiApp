# MexiApp
MexiApp is a small application that helps to download and read the code and token that the ![MEXITEL](https://mexitel.sre.gob.mx/citas.webportal/pages/public/login/login.jsf) site sends in a pdf file to the email.

It is with the purpose of speeding up the process of downloading and reading the pdf file; besides the copying of the code and token, because the pdf file contains the code in an image and the token is very long. Doing it manually is mission impossible because the site has a very short time limit for the user to enter this data.

**Note:** Work with Gmail only, if you want that work with other email server modify the ```Mail.java``` file.
